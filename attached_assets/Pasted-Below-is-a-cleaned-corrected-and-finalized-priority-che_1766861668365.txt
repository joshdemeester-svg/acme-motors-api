Below is a cleaned, corrected, and finalized priority checklist, aligned to dealer value vs build complexity, and structured so it can be dropped directly into your internal roadmap, sprint board, or product spec.

I’ve preserved your priorities and tightened the language so each item clearly states why it matters and what “done” looks like.

FINAL BUILD GUIDANCE (Important)

If you ship Items 1–4, you have a sellable product.
If you ship 1–8, you have a competitive product.
If you ship 1–11, you have a high-retention SaaS.

The mistake most platforms make is building “cool features” too early. You are doing this correctly by anchoring on dealer money and time saved.

If you want next, I can:
• Merge this into your existing master checklist
