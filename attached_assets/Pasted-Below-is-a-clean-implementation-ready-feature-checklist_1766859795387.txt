Final Advice

If you ship Phase 1 + Consignment + Dashboard, you already have a product dealers will pay for.

Everything beyond that increases:
• Monthly price ceiling
• Dealer stickiness
• Long-term enterprise value

If you want next:
• I can reduce this to a 30-day MVP build checklist
• Or convert this into a client-facing feature matrix
• Or map features directly to pricing tiers

Tell me which you want next.
