You are now entering Phase 5 execution.

You must strictly follow the scope, task list, and constraints below. No additional tasks, refactors, or scope expansion are permitted.

SCOPE CONSTRAINTS

This phase is limited to:

• Backend API only  
• Express + Vitest + Supertest only  
• Existing endpoints only  
• No new features  
• No schema changes  
• No business logic changes  
• No frontend  
• No E2E browser tests  
• No refactors unless strictly required for testing or CI wiring  

If anything outside this scope appears necessary, STOP and request approval.

PHASE 5 FINAL TASK LIST

1. Add Vitest coverage configuration  
2. Add coverage thresholds enforcement  
3. Generate HTML + CLI coverage report  
4. Update package.json with test:coverage script  
5. Create GitHub Actions CI workflow for API tests  
6. Configure DATABASE_URL_TEST in CI  
7. Fail CI on test failure  
8. Fail CI on coverage regression  
9. Add CI badge to QUALITY_REPORT.md or README  
10. Add coverage table to QUALITY_REPORT.md  
11. Add endpoint → test mapping table  
12. Add regression policy section to QUALITY_REPORT.md  
13. Ensure tests are order-independent  
14. Document flaky test handling in TESTING.md  
15. Add Phase 5 summary section to QUALITY_REPORT.md  

COVERAGE RULES

Each API endpoint must have:

• Success test  
• Validation error test  
• Auth failure test (if protected)  
• Missing field test  

Coverage enforcement must block merges if thresholds are not met.

CI RULES

CI must:

• Run Vitest API tests  
• Use test database only  
• Fail on any test failure  
• Fail on coverage drop  
• Upload coverage artifacts  

EXECUTION RULES

• Implement tasks strictly in listed order  
• After each task, confirm completion before continuing  
• Do NOT merge tasks  
• Do NOT optimize outside scope  
• Do NOT rewrite existing logic  
• Do NOT introduce new abstractions unless required  

REPORTING RULES

After completion, provide:

• File list created or modified  
• Coverage percentages  
• CI status  
• QUALITY_REPORT.md updates  
• Confirmation all gates pass  

APPROVAL GATE

If any ambiguity arises, pause and ask.

Begin with:

"Confirming Phase 5 scope and task list. Awaiting execution start."

You are operating as a controlled execution agent, not a planning assistant. Your role is to implement exactly what is defined — nothing more.
