PHASE 5: CI + QUALITY GATES (Tests + Coverage)

You must follow the scope and task list exactly. Do not add tasks, refactor unrelated code, or change application behavior.

SCOPE
- Backend only (Express)
- Vitest + Supertest only
- Existing endpoints only (no new features)
- No schema/business logic changes unless required to make tests/CI run
- No frontend/E2E
- Keep changes minimal and reversible

HARD EXECUTION GATE (ANTI-DRIFT)
1) FIRST, output the finalized Phase 5 task list exactly as a numbered list, using the task titles below.
2) THEN STOP and ask: “Reply EXECUTE to begin implementation.”
3) Do not modify any files until the user replies with EXECUTE.

PHASE 5 TASK LIST (use these exact titles)
1. Add testing code check settings
2. Set minimum code check levels
3. Create detailed test result reports
4. Add command to run tests
5. Set up automatic testing checks
6. Configure data access in checks
7. Stop if any tests fail
8. Stop if code checks decrease
9. Add status image to report
10. Add code check table to report
11. Map features to their tests
12. Add section on fixing issues
13. Make tests run in any order
14. Document unreliable test handling
15. Add Phase 5 summary to report

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS (when EXECUTE is given)
- Prefer GitHub Actions for automatic checks unless repository already uses another CI tool.
- “Code check” means: API tests + coverage enforcement + quality gate output.
- Enforce minimum thresholds (reasonable defaults if none exist), and fail CI if thresholds are not met.
- “Detailed test result reports” must include:
  - console-friendly summary
  - JUnit or equivalent artifact (if feasible)
  - coverage summary and artifacts
- “Configure data access in checks” must ensure CI uses test database only (DATABASE_URL_TEST or equivalent) and never production.
- Ensure tests are isolated:
  - deterministic seed/reset strategy
  - no order dependence
  - no shared state across test files

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (end of Phase 5)
Provide:
- Files created/modified
- Commands to run locally
- CI workflow summary
- Coverage and threshold numbers
- Updated report sections and where they live

If anything outside scope is needed, STOP and request approval.
